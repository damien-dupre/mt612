## A model paper based on simulation data to explain the principle of academic writing

Damien Dupré, DCU Business School

## Abstract
</center>
*The present paper draws from the paper entitled "Righting a wrong: Retaliation on a voodoo doll symbolizing an abusive supervisor restores justice" (Liang et al., 2018). This academic article was published in the journal "The Leadership Quarterly" and has been awarded with the prestigious IG Nobel Price (section Business Studies). The paper looked at how subordinate retaliation moderates the relationship between abusive supervision and subordinate injustice perception. More precisely, the authors asked their participants to imagine an abusive or non-abusive supervision context and they measured how much using a virtual voodoo doll, representing the supervisor, would restore people's sense of justice. By testing the hypotheses formulated by its authors on simulated data, the present paper will describe each step of the academic writing.*

  'Abusive supervision is a problem for the mental well-being of employees. In cases of behaviours charactering abusive supervision such as such as public ridicule, yelling, scapegoating, or other forms of supervisor mistreatment, employees will have to deploy coping-mechanisms in order to preserve enough motivation to work in this negative environment. The premise of the paper Righting a wrong: Retaliation on a voodoo doll symbolizing an abusive supervisor restores justice is that `a natural response for the subordinate is to directly retaliate against the abusive supervisor` (Liang et al., 2018, p. 443). This premise is probably what made the paper published by Liang et al. (2018) an excellent candidate for the IG Nobel. However, this paper has an excellent structure and a very robust method. For these reasons, it will be used as example of how to write an academic paper.',

A p-value higher than indicates that the null hypothesis is true whereas a p-value lower than 0.05 indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis considered as plausible.
